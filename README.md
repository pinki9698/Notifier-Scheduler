# Notifier-Scheduler
#The Intern Academy WELCOME TO MY Python PROJECT ON Notifier Scheduler(Task 1).

# Task 1
   Create a python scheduler notifier :
      In this project you need to add tasks with a notification time and at that time, it will ring as alarm and notify you about your tasks. Different types of tunes will be used       to notify the person. Make a list of those tasks that need to be performed with time intervals and these task will be notified to the user after that
      particular interval and it will be tuned again and again.
